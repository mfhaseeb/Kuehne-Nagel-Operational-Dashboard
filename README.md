# Kuehne-Nagel-Operational-Dashboard

This project is a dynamic **Excel Dashboard** developed during my **Data Operations Internship at Kuehne + Nagel**, one of the world's leading logistics companies.

The dashboard was designed to provide Data Operations teams and managers with a consolidated, real-time view of critical logistics and supply chain performance indicators (KPIs).

## üõ†Ô∏è Excel Technical Features Demonstrated

This dashboard was built using advanced Excel techniques to ensure interactivity and data accuracy:

* **Dynamic Charts:** Utilization of **Pivot Charts** and standard charts to dynamically track weekly performance across 52 weeks of data.
* **KPI Calculation:** Use of complex **Excel functions** (like `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`) to calculate and display real-time KPIs (e.g., **52.8% On Time Delivery**).
* **Visual Design:** Custom formatting, card layouts, and conditional logic to replicate the professional look and feel required for executive operational monitoring.
